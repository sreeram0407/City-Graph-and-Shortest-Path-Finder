# City Graph and Shortest Path Finder 🌐

## Author: Sreeram Kondapalli 🧑‍💻

### Description 📜

This project represents a **graph of cities** and their interconnections, allowing for the determination of the shortest paths between cities using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**. The code is diligently crafted in C++, focusing on object-oriented principles and modular programming paradigms.

### Features 🌟

- **Header Inclusions and Namespace** 📚
   - Essential headers and namespaces are integrated for smooth functionality.
   
- **Function Prototypes** 🛠
   - Functions such as `getCityInfo` and `getArrCityInfo` are pre-declared.
   
- **Main Function** 🚀
   - Orchestrates the primary logic flow, involving city and distance processing.
   
- **Function Definitions** 🔍
   - Detailed functions to dissect and process user inputs and graph information.
   
- **User Interaction** 💬
   - Engaging user prompts allowing for easy navigation and utilization of the functionalities.

### How to Run 🚀

1. Ensure all dependencies, including the `"Graph.h"` header, are correctly configured. 🧩
2. Compile the C++ code. 🔧
3. Launch the executable and interact via the console, plunging into a world of city graphs and shortest paths exploration! 🖥

### Future Development 🚀

- 🛠 **Enhanced Error Handling**: Making the application more resilient and user-proof.
- 🖥 **UI/UX Improvements**: Revamping user interactions for an enhanced, intuitive experience.
